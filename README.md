why cells cannot achieve the maximal capacity of all of their enzymes

We criticize the notion of an “unused enzyme fraction” used to describe metabolic states, which suggests a deliberate deviation from optimality. Instead, we claim that enzymes, even if they do not operate at their full capacity, may be almost efficiently used given the inevitable constraints in metabolism. To demonstrate this with models, we show that additional constraints or more complex objectives lead to higher and higher required enzyme investments. This is described in the picture of a “glass ceiling”.
